| **Power Analysis**       | In the setting of our proposed Bayesian outcome models we used a simulation based approach to estimate the effect of sample size on the precision of our estimates. See full text for details - assuming some further exclusion from 1.1 million patients the sample size will be more than sufficient to generate precise effect estimates under our modeling assumptions.                                                                                                                                         |

| **Statistical Approach** | We will use a pseudo-Bayesian propensity score weighting approach whereby we first estimate a multilevel propensity score model and then use overlap and inverse probability of treatment weights generated from this model to estimate the effect of prophylaxis compliance using a Bayesian outcome model for PONV. See full text for modeling details and justification. Several sensitivity analyses are proposed, including alternative modeling approaches and alternative prior distribution specifications. |
